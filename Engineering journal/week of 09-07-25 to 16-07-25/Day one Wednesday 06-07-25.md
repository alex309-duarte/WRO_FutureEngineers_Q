Throughout Wednesday, July 10, we dedicated ourselves specifically to [disassembling the robot](https://github.com/alex309-duarte/WRO_FutureEngineers_Q/tree/main/Photos/Photos%20of%20the%20national/Disassembling%20the%20robot) because we needed to make it lighter, more compact, and faster. 

For this national stage of the competition, we plan to use a RP lidar to map the track. Therefore, modifications are necessary if we want to use this sensor and improve our performance in the challenge.

You can see today's work in the photos section.
