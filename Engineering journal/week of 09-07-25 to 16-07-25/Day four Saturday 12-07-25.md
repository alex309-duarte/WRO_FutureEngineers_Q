The Ackerman systems, the two new ones that were built and that we had, were thoroughly analyzed. For this, trigonometry and AutoCAD were used.  ![Photos/Photos of the national/Ackerman system/IMG-20250712-WA0001.jpg](https://github.com/alex309-duarte/WRO_FutureEngineers_Q/blob/main/Photos/Photos%20of%20the%20national/Ackerman%20system/IMG-20250712-WA0001.jpg)  Lego units were used to create diagrams and calculations. The idea of having a car with two Ackermans that turn in opposite directions to make tighter turns and make parking easier was also proposed.
